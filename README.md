Local Setup Instructions for Rails Application
Prerequisites:

Git installed on your machine
Ruby (version mentioned in the repository's .ruby-version file or Gemfile)
Rails (version mentioned in the Gemfile)
PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite (depending on what database the app uses)
Node.js and Yarn (for JavaScript dependencies if the app uses modern JS)

Step 1: Clone the Repository
bashCopy# Replace REPO_NAME with the actual repository name
git clone https://github.com/khalidMahmod/REPO_NAME.git
cd REPO_NAME
Step 2: Install Dependencies
bashCopy# Install Ruby dependencies
bundle install

# Install JavaScript dependencies (if applicable)
yarn install # or npm install
Step 3: Database Setup
bashCopy# Create the database
rails db:create

# Run migrations
rails db:migrate

# Seed the database with sample data (if applicable)
rails db:seed
Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables
Check if the application uses environment variables:

Look for a .env.example or config/application.yml.example file
Copy it to .env or config/application.yml and fill in the required values

bashCopycp .env.example .env
# Then edit the .env file with your specific values
Step 5: Start the Server
bashCopy# Start the Rails server
rails server # or rails s

# In some applications, you might need to run the webpack dev server in parallel
bin/webpack-dev-server # (in another terminal window)
Step 6: Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:
Copyhttp://localhost:3000
Troubleshooting Tips:

Check the README.md file in the repository for specific setup instructions
If you encounter any errors during setup, check the application logs in log/development.log
For database issues, ensure your database server is running and credentials are correct
For Rails 6+ applications with Webpacker, ensure Node.js and Yarn are properly installed
